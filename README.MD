# My Python Tutorial
**Abstraction:** "Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity."
In the code that is provided the method Payment has child classes that hide what the payment method does.

**Encapsulation:** "It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data."
In the code provided for encapsulation the person has two variables which is name and age, they are both used directly as well as through the methods in this case init. 

**Inheritance:** "is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined."
The example of inheritance it provides an example of how class calls another class to run a code. In this example, Account calls has methods such as accountNum, withdraw and deposit. Another class which is called privledgedAccount refers to Account for withdraw and deposit methods. 

**Polymorphism:** "is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input."
For the code example of Polymorphism, I used a basic formula for addition in which numbers can be interchangable.
